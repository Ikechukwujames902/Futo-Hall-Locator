This is a Web app that helps new students of Futo find their way around campus

## Problem
Navigating ones way around campus has been a big challenge faced by freshers (New students) in our school FUTO.
This problem can lead to lateness to lectures or even registrations and meetings that are vital to every fresher.

They opt to finding their way around by asking people questions, this could be time consuming and may even place them in the hands of bad meaning people that may take advantage of their ignorance and exploit the in all sort of ways.

## solution
I and Madubuike Ikechukwu have created this app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript integrating Google maps API to help freshers locate buildings and lecture halls on campus in the easeist way possible


## Demo
The Link to the app will be included here
